                <p>
                    Brazil has developed some of the most comprehensive legal frameworks in Latin America to combat
                    violence against women. These laws emerged from decades of activism, survivor advocacy, and global
                    human rights pressure.

                <p>
                    For much of Brazil's history, violence against women was treated as a private matter rather than a
                    human rights violation. Beginning in the 1980s, grassroots feminist movements, survivor stories, and
                    international conventions pushed the country to recognize gender-based violence as a public issue.
                    Over time, this activism has led to landmark laws that protect women, punish aggressors, and create
                    specialized services.

                    attempts by her husband, the law transformed domestic violence from a "family issue" into a serious

                    Despite legal advances, Brazil continues to face high rates of lethal violence against women. In

                    are women" as an aggravated form of homicide, often linked to domestic violence, discrimination, or
                    control.

                    Together, these recent changes show that the legal system is still evolving. Brazil's laws are moving
                    toward a more <strong>holistic view of violence</strong> that includes psychological, economic, and digital harm instead of just physical aggression.

                <p>
                    Even with strong laws, many women in Brazil continue to experience violence in their homes, at work,
                    online, and in public spaces. Underreporting, slow court processes, lack of shelters, and unequal
                    access to legal aid leave countless survivors without full protection. Black, Indigenous, LGBTQIA+,
                    and poor women often face the greatest barriers when seeking help.

                <p>
                    These legal reforms are central to achieving <strong>UN Sustainable Development Goal 5.2</strong>:
                    eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls in public and private spheres. However, for
                    the laws to truly work, they must be fully funded, widely known, and consistently enforced across
                    all regions of Brazil.
