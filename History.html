                <p>
                Durning the early 1900s the growth of the women's movement in United States of America speared to Brazil. Many women supported the movement however, higharched and race played a major part in how serious the women were taken. Many with darker skin were not taken sensually and were written off while those with lighter skin were able to state and spread their beliefs more freely. This made it hard for those who supported the movement to achieve their goal of more rights.

                <p>
                    In 1888 there was a decline in slavery in Brazil, making factories low on labor. They considered having immigrants come in to work in place of the slaves, but decided that having women and childer would be a good alturnitive.
                </p>
                    Women and children worked in spinning and weaving factories while men tend to work in shoes and furniture factories. Women were making up 16.74% of the factory industry. (Making up 68% of the spinning and weaving industry). The low wadge for women created a dramatic increase of overtime working and, or prostitution.
                <p>
                     Now a-days there is still a gender gap in wages as well as positions. Many people who are in factory positions are still considered less than those in higher positions (lawyers, doctors, etc.). The gender gap with pay reflects the imagery of women in Brazil. While women in Brazil make up majority of college students, they make 28% less than a man in the same position.</p>

                <p>
                 In 1932 women were allowed to vote in Brazil however they did not receive the full rights that men had until 1945. Most men in government stated that they "granted women to vote" and that it was a favor to them. The divided in hierarchy still played a major rule as the common women were still considered for men and not as individuals themselves.

                <p>
                In 2009 there was an increase in <strong>police vilence</strong> directly linked with <strong>wemon's vilence</strong> at that time. In the next few years there were an increase of protesting against police as well as women's vilence, demestic abuse, and enequality. 
                </p>
                Between the early 2000s and 2023 there were little to no change in vilence levels in Brazil so Brazilens went to protest. Different groups: Marcha das Margaridas, Ele Não Movement, Articulação dos Povos Indígenas do Brasil (APIB) / Indigenous Women's March, and more.
                <p>
                <strong>Even though there has been a slight decrease in female vilence due to protesting and politics, 30% of women still experience some sort of vilence, abuse, or discrimination.</strong>
