        <p><i><b>In 1983, Maria da Penha Maia Fernandes, a Brazilian biopharmacist, survived two homicide attempts at home. The first one left her paralyzed from the waist down after she was shot while she was asleep. In the second attempt, she was almost electrocuted in the shower.</b></i></p>

        <p>When Maria da Penha was almost killed by her husband, there wasn't a single police station she could go to in Brazil specialising in violence against women. "At that time we weren't even aware of this expression - domestic violence," she says. "You just had a bad husband." It's over 40 years since Maria da Penha first encountered the man who would change her life so dramatically.</p>

        <p>She was studying to become a bio-pharmacist in Sao Paulo when she met Marcos Antonio Heredia Viveros, a schoolteacher originally from Colombia, through mutual friends. He was likeable and helpful, and they quickly fell in love. In 1976 they were married. After Maria finished her studies, the couple moved back to her home city of Fortaleza, on Brazil's north eastern coast, and they began a family. But the man she had fallen in love with soon began to change.</p> 

        <p>"When his Brazilian citizenship was granted, he showed his true colours," Maria recalls. "I had no idea of how to make him go back to what he was like before. "I didn't know if he would wake up in a good mood or a bad mood. He became violent, hitting the children for no reason. That started to make me feel unsafe in my marriage." Maria says there was no single trigger for the change in his behaviour. And anything, however big or small, would set him off.</p>
            
        <p>"At the time my daughters were aged seven, five and almost two. My little one still wasn't walking. One day she was sitting on the floor and she wet herself. "Then she got up and with her little wet hands, she tried to support herself using the wall. She got the wall wet. So he hit her and shouted at her. He really slapped her hard." Maria's middle daughter used to suck her thumb, and he tied her hands to stop her doing it. "I wasn't here, I was told about this later," says Maria. "When she managed to untie it, he hit her hard and put her in the shower under cold water." As the violence continued, Maria felt trapped, isolated and alone. "The only people who knew that I was suffering abuse were me and the girls who lived with us," she says. "I spared my family because if they knew they would have told me to get a divorce."</p>

        <p><b>But things came to a head one terrible night in May 1983.</b></p>

        <p>Maria was at home with her husband and children. "I was sleeping when I heard a big bang in the room. I tried to move and couldn't. Immediately I thought: 'Marco has killed me.' "Our neighbours, who were doctors, came and found me in a terrible state, lying on the bed, on top of the wound. There was a hole in my back and I was losing a lot of blood onto the mattress. The mattress was soaked." Maria had been shot by her husband, the bullet lodging in her spine. But her husband told police that he'd been woken up by a noise, and had got up and found four strangers in the house. After a struggle, he said they'd tied him up and then they had shot Maria. The police appeared to believe him, and since she was immediately rushed to hospital, Maria's version of events was not heard until later. No one was arrested.</p>

        <p>After four months in hospital, Maria, now paralysed from the waist down, returned to the family home. The police investigation into the shooting was still inconclusive. And even Maria herself was beginning to doubt whether it really could have been her husband. She had no evidence to back up her suspicions. But once she was home, the abuse continued. </p>

        <p>"The day I came back, he told me as we were still driving home that I wasn't to have any visitors - no neighbour, no friends, no family - without his consent," Maria says. "I was kept under a sort of house arrest. My family would call and I'd make up excuses - I'd tell them: 'I'm too tired' - so that they wouldn't come to see me. So as to obey his orders." </p>
        
        <p>Eventually, in spite of everything she'd been through and in spite of her husband's attempts to keep her isolated from the outside world, Maria began to look for a way out. Without her husband's knowledge, she tried to get a court order giving her custody of the children so that she could flee the house. Before she could do so, Viveros made one more attempt to kill her - this time trying to electrocute her by tampering with the electric shower when she was bathing.</p>
        
        <p><b>Miraculously, she survived - and then left for good.</b></p>

        <p>A year into their relationship, he began to drink more, forbade her from seeing friends, and became violent, she said.

        <p><i><b>A young woman from Roraima was a victim of human trafficking because, like many young women and men, she believed in a job offer with a good salary and then found herself trapped in a cruel trap of aggression, prostitution, and even witnessed the death of other girls. This case happened recently in the southern region of the state. </b></i></p>

    <p>In the interview, still very shaken, she becomes emotional when remembering details—from the moment she was approached by a woman in Boa Vista who offered her the job, to the moment she escaped the place, and the period when she was locked inside her own home out of fear of being found. </p>
    
    <p> The young woman said that it all happened when she was going through a difficult time in her life: the end of her marriage, unemployment, and raising a small daughter. “I met this woman in Boa Vista. Beautiful, well-dressed, and very polite. I told her about my situation, and she promptly promised help. Our conversations became frequent until one day we went out at night to a bar, where we talked and drank. I remember being hit with something on my head and passing out. When I woke up, I was in another city here in Roraima.” </p>
    
    <p>When she woke up, still confused by everything that had happened, the young woman realized she was in a house that at first did not appear to be for prostitution. “I spent two days fine, and I remember the presence of a man and a woman, both Venezuelans, but I never saw again the woman who promised me the job,” she said. On the third day, according to her, other girls appeared, another man, and another woman. “In front of the place there was a bar, and in the back there was a room where almost 30 girls slept. That space was very small for the number of girls, but it was where we slept and had our snacks,” she said.</p>
    
    <p><b>Five endless days of suffering</b></p>

    <p>Five days that felt like an eternity. With her head lowered and tears streaming down her face, the young woman said that this period was the worst of her life, because during that time she suffered severe psychological and physical abuse and often became disoriented. “In that house we didn't have breakfast, lunch, or dinner. They only offered soda and crackers, and we were weak, with no strength at all,” she reported. She also recalled that the girls were not locked up but were watched by lookouts.</p>

    <p>The young woman also said that the girls were forced to have sex with men, and those who refused were punished. “I met two girls—we even planned an escape together—but one night they were murdered with a gun that made no noise. Their bodies were dragged into the woods. I saw them die. They did that to scare us. And I was very afraid; I only thought about my daughter,” she lamented.</p>

    <p>After the girls’ deaths, the young woman wanted to leave the place as soon as possible, but to make that happen she needed to think of something that could not go wrong, because otherwise she already knew what her fate would be.</p> 

    <p><b>An angel who appeared at the right time</b></p>

    <p>One day the house was very busy, and the young woman saw hope arrive. A young man appeared, accompanied by a friend, to pick a girl to go out with. “This young man said he saw me standing apart from everyone, and that’s why he went to talk to me,” she recalled. “He realized I wasn’t happy, and I told him I needed help. He promised to come back and help me escape—and that’s what he did,” she said.</p> 

    <p>She said that the next day, the same man appeared at the house and, so that no one would suspect his intention, he paid for a session and left with her. “This guy took me to his house and I told him everything—my situation, my family.” Listening carefully to her story, his first instinct was to take her to a police station in a nearby town, but she said she didn’t feel safe. “I was very afraid. I didn’t trust anyone, thinking they might take me back there.” Even fearful, from the police station she was sent to Boa Vista, where she began receiving assistance from CREAS (Specialized Social Assistance Reference Center) professionals.</p>
